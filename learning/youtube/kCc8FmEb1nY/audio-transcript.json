So clearly the sulf attention had is doing some useful communication, but we still have a long way to go. Okay, so now we've implemented the scale dot product attention.

  "full_transcript": "Hi everyone.  So by now you have probably heard of ChatGPT. It has taken the world and AI Community by storm, and it is a system that allows you to interact with an AI and give it text-based tasks. So for example, we can ask ChatGPT to write as a small haiku about how important it is that people understand Ai and then they can use it to improve the world and make it more prosperous.  so, when we run this,  AI knowledge brings prosperity for all to see Embrace its power. Okay, not bad. And so you could see that ChatGPT went from left to right and generated. All these words, see sort of sequentially  Now, I asked it already the exact same problem, a little bit earlier, and it generated a slightly different outcome, ai's power to grow ignorance. Holds us back, learn Prosperity, weights.  So pretty good in both cases and slightly different. So you can see that ChatGPT is a probabilistic system and for anyone prompt it can give us multiple answers sort of replying to it.  Now this is just one example of a prompt, people have come up with many, many examples and there are entire websites that index interactions with ChatGPT. And so many of them are quite humorous. Explain HTML to me like a dog writes notes for chest to Right to note about Elon Musk, buying a Twitter.  And so on.  So as an example, please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree  In a shocking turn of events, a leaf has fallen from a tree in the local park Witnesses report that the leaf which was previously attached to a branch of a tree detached itself and fell to the ground. Very dramatic.  So you can see that this is a pretty remarkable system, and it is what we call a language model because it models, the sequence of words or characters or tokens more generally, and it knows how sort of warts follow each other in English language.  And so from its perspective, what it is doing is it is completing the sequence. So I give it the start of a sequence and it completes the sequence with the outcome and so it's a language model in that sense.  Now, I would like to focus on the, under the hood of underhood components of what makes Jack GPT work. So what does the neural network on the hood that models? The sequence of these words,  And that comes from the paper called attention is, all you need in 2017 and landmark paper, Landmark paper and AI that produced and proposed the Transformer architecture. So, GPT is short for generally generally pre-trained Transformer. So Transformer is the neural net that actually does all the heavy lifting under the hood. It comes from this paper in 2017. Now, if you read this paper, this reads like a pretty random machine translation paper. And that's because I think the authors didn't fully anticipate the impact that the Transformer would have on the field and this architecture that they produced in the context of machine translation in their case, actually ended up taking over the rest of AI in the next five years after. And so this architecture with minor changes was copy, paste it into a huge amount of applications in AI in more recent years. And that includes at the core of ChatGPT.  Now we are not going to what I'd like to do now is I'd like to build out something like ChatGPT, but we're not going to be able to, of course reproduce ChatGPT. This is a very serious production grade system. It is trained on a good chunk of internet and then there's a lot of pre-training and fine-tuning stages to it and so it's very complicated what I'd like to focus on is just to train a Transformer, based language model. And in our case it's going to be a character level. The language model. I still think that is a very educational with respect to how these systems work.  So I don't want to train on the chunk of Internet. We need a smaller data set in this case, I propose that we work with my favorite toy data set, it's called tiny Shakespeare. And what it is is basically, it's a concatenation of all of the works of Shakespeare in my understanding. And so this is all of Shakespeare in a single file, this file is about one megabyte.  And it's just all of Shakespeare.  And what we are going to do now is we're going to basically model how these characters follow each other. So for example, give in a chunk of these characters like this,  Given some context of characteristics in the past, the Transformer, neural network will look at the characteristics that I've highlighted and is going to predict that g is likely to come next in the sequence. And it's going to do that because we're going to train that Transformer on Shakespeare. And it's just going to try to produce character sequences that look like this.  And in that process is going to model all the patterns inside this data.  So once we've trained the system, I just like to give you a preview we can generate infinite Shakespeare and of course it's a fake thing that looks kind of like Shakespeare. um,  apologies for there's some Jank that I'm not able to resolve in in here, but  You can see how this is going character by character and it's kind of like predicting Shakespeare like language so verily. My Lord, the sights have left the again the king coming with my curses with precious pale  And then Toronto says something else. Etc. And this is just coming out of the Transformer in a very similar manner, as it would come out in ChatGPT, in our case character, by character in ChatGPT it's coming out on the token by token, level and tokens are these sort of like a little suburb pieces so they're not Word level, they're kind of like work chunk level.  and,  Now, I've already written this entire code to train these Transformers.  And it is in a GitHub repository that you can find and it's called a nano GPT.  So Nano GT is a repository that you can find them at and it's a repository for training Transformers on any given text.  And what I think is interesting about it because there's many ways to train Transformers about. This is a very simple implementation, so it's just two files of 300 lives of code. Each one filed defines, the cheap tea model the Transformer and one file Transit on some given Text data set. And here I'm showing that if you train it, on the open web Text data set, which is a fairly large data. Set of web pages, then I reproduce the the performance of gpt2.  So gpt2 is an early version of openai's GPT from 2017, if hire correctly and I've only so far, I produced the smallest 124 million parameter model. But basically this is just proving that the code base is correctly arranged and I'm able to load the neural network weights that opening I has released later.  So you can take a look at the finished code here in a minGPT. But would I would like to do in this lecture is I would like to basically write this repository from scratch. So we're going to begin with an empty file and we're going to define a Transformer piece by piece.  We're going to train it on the tiny Shakespeare data set.  And we'll see how we can then generate infinite Shakespeare.  And of course this can copy paste to any arbitrary Text data set that you like, but my goal really here is to just make you understand and appreciate how under the hood ChatGPT works. And really all that is required is a Proficiency in Python and some basic understanding of calculus statistics and it would help if you also see my previous videos on the same YouTube channel. In particular, my make more series where I Define smaller and simpler neural network language models. So multi-level perceptrons and so on it really introduces the language modeling framework and then here in this video, we're going to focus on the Transformer, neural network itself.  Okay, so I created a new Google call appropriate notebook here.  And this will allow me to later easily. Share this code that we're going to develop together with you so you can follow along. So this will be in a video description later.  Now here I've just done some preliminaries, I downloaded the data set, the tiny Shakespeare data sets at this URL and you can see that it's about a one megabyte file.  Then here I open the input, txt file and just reading all the text as a string.  and we see that we are working with one million characters, roughly  And the first 1000 characters if we just print them out our basically, what you would expect, this is the first 1000 characters of the tiny Shakespeare data, set, roughly up to here.  So far, so good. Next we're going to take this text and the text is a sequence of characters in Python. So when I called the set Constructor on it, I'm just going to get the set of old character that occur in this text.  And then I call list on that to create a list of those characters instead of just a set so that I have an ordering an arbitrary ordering. and then, I sort that  So basically, we get just all the characters that are currently entire data set and they're sorted.  Now, the number of them is going to be our vocabulary size. These are the possible elements of our sequences, and we see that when I print here, the characters,  There's 65 of them in total. There's a space character and then all kinds of special characters.  And then capitals and lowercase letters. So that's our vocabulary. And that's the sort of like possible character that then model can see, or emit.  Okay, so next we would like to develop some strategy to tokenize the input text.  Now when people say tokenize, they mean convert the raw text as a string to some sequence of integers. According to some note, According to some vocabulary of possible elements.  So as an example here, we are going to be building a character level language model. So we're simply going to be translating individual characters into integers.  So, let me show you a chunk of code that sort of does that for us.  So we're building both the encoder and the decoder.  And let me just talk through What's Happening Here.  When we encode an arbitrary text there, we're going to receive a list of integers that represents that string. So for example, 4647 Etc. And then we also have the reverse mapping, so we can take this list and decode it to get back the exact same string.  So it's really just like a translation to integers and back for arbitrary string and for us it is done on a character level.  Now, the way this was achieved is we just iterate over all the characters here and create a lookup table from the character to the integer and vice versa. And then, to encode some string, we simply translate all the characters individually and to decode it back, we use the reverse mapping concatenate all of it.  Now, this is only one of many possible encodings or many possible sort of tokenizers. And it's a very simple one. There's many other schemas that people have come up with in practice. So, for example, Google uses sentence piece.  So sentence piece will also encode text into integers, but in a different schema and using a different vocabulary and sentence piece is a sub word, sort of tokenizer. And what that means is that you're not encoding entire words, but you're not also encoding individual characters. It's a sub word unit level and that's usually what's adopted in practice. For example, also opening AI has this Library called tiktokin that uses a bite, pair encoding tokenizer. Um, and that's what GPT uses.  And you can also just encode words into like hell world into a list of integers.  So, as an example, I'm using the tiktok and Library here.  I'm getting the encoding for gpt2, or that was used for gpt2 instead of just having 65 possible characters or tokens. They have 50,000 tokens  And so, when they encode the exact same string, hi there. We only get a list of three integers, but those integers are not between 0 and 64, the arm between 0 and 5000 50,256.  So basically you can trade off the code book size and the sequence lengths. So you can have a very long sequences of integers with very small vocabulary or we can have a short  Sequences of integers with very large remote. Capillaries. And so typically people use in practice these subordinate encodings, but I'd like to keep our tokenizer, very simple. So we're using character level tokenizer.  And that means that we have very small code books. We have very simple encode, and decode functions, but we do get very long sequences as a result. But that's the level at which we're going to stick with this lecture because the simplest thing, okay? So now that we have encoder and a decoder, effectively tokenizer, we can tokenize the entire training set of Shakespeare so here's a chunk of code that does that  And I'm going to start to use the pytorch library and specifically the torture tensor from the pytorch library.  So we're going to take all of the text in tiny Shakespeare encoded and then wrap it into a torch dot tensor to get the data tensor. So, here's what the data tensor looks like. When I look at just the first 1000 characters or the 1000 elements of it,  So we see that we have a massive sequence of integers, and this sequence of integers here is basically an identical translation of the first 1000 characters here.  So I believe for example, that 0 is a new line character and maybe one is a space, not 100% sure. But from now on the entire data set of text is we represented as just it's just stretched out, that is a single very large sequence of integers.  Let me do one more thing before we move on here, I'd like to separate out our data set into a train and a validation split. So in particular, we're going to take the first 90% of the data set and consider that to be the training data for the Transformer, and we're going to withhold the last 10% and the end of it to be the validation data and this will help us understand to what extent our model is overfitting. So we're going to basically hide and keep the validation data on the side because we don't want just a perfect memorization of this exact Shakespeare. We want in your own network that sort of create Shakespeare like text. And so it should be fairly likely for it to produce. The actual like stowed away. True Shakespeare text.  And so, we're going to use this to get a sense of the overfitting. Okay. So now we would like to start plugging these text sequences or integer sequences into the Transformer. So that it can train and learn those patterns.  Now, the important thing to realize is we're never going to actually feed the entire text into Transformer. All at once that would be computationally, very expensive and prohibitive.  So, when we actually train a Transformer on a lot of these datasets, we only work with chunks of the data set. And when we train the Transformer, we basically sample, random little chunks, out of the training set, and training on just chunks, at a time. And these chunks have basically, some kind of a length.  And some maximum length.  Now, the maximum length typically, at least in the code, I usually write is called block size.  You can you can find it on the different names like contacts length, or something like that. Let's start with the box size of just ate and let me look at the first train data character's, the first block size, plus one characteristics. I'll explain why, plus one is second.  So this is the first nine characters in the sequence in the training set. Now, what I'd like to point out is that when you sample a chunk of data like this. So say these nine characters out of the training set,  this actually has multiple examples packed into it.  And that's because all of these characters, follow each other.  And so what this thing is going to say when we plug it into a Transformer,  Is we're going to actually simultaneously train it to make prediction at every one of these positions.  Now, in the in a chunk of nine characters, there's actually eight individual examples packed in there.  So there's the example that when 18 when in the contest of 1847, luckily comes next in a context of 18 and 47, 56 comes next.  In a contest of 184756, 57. Can come next and so on. So that's the 8 individual examples. Let me actually spell it out with code.  so, here's the trunk of code to illustrate  X are the inputs to the Transformer. It will just be the first block size character's.  Why will be the next block size character's? So it's offset by one.  And that's because why are the targets for each position in the input? And then here, I'm iterating over all the block size of 8.  And the context is always, all the characters in X up to T and including t.  And the target is always the teeth character, but in the targets array, why?  So, let me just run this.  And basically it spells out. What I said in words, these are the eight examples hidden in a chunk of 9 characters that we sampled from the training set.  I want to mention one more thing. We trained on all the eight examples here with context between one all the way up to contacts of block size.  And we train on that, not just for computational reasons, because we happen to have the sequence of ready or something like that. It's not just them for efficiency. It's also done to make the Transformer Network. Be used to seeing contacts all the way from as little as one old way to block size.  And we'd like, to transform to be used to seeing everything in between and that's going to be useful later during inference. Because while we're sampling, we can start to set a sampling generation with as little as one character of contacts. And then Transformer knows how to predict next character with all the way up to just contacts of one. And so, then it can predict everything up to block size. And after block size, we have to start truncating because the Transformer will never receive more than block size inputs when it's predicting the next character. Okay. So we've looked at the time dimension of the tensors that are going to be feeding into the Transformer. There's one more Dimension to care about and that is the batch dimension.  And so, as we're sampling, these chunks of text, we're going to be actually, every time we're going to feed them into a Transformer. We're going to have many batches of multiple chunks of texts that are also like stacked up in a single tensor and that's just done for efficiency just so that we can keep the gpus busy because they are very good at parallel processing of of data and so we just want to process multiple chunks all at the same time, but those chunks are processed completely independently. They don't talk to each other and so on.  So let me basically just generalize this and introduced a batch Dimension. Here's a chunk of code.  I'm just run it and then I'm going to explain what it does.  So here because we're going to start sampling random locations in the data set to pull chunks from. I am setting the seed so that in the random number generator. So that the number is I see here are going to be the same numbers. You see later, if you try to reproduce this,  Now the backside is here is, how many independency sequences we are processing every forward backward. Pass of the Transformer.  The block size as I explained is the maximum contact lengths to make those predictions. So let's say by size 4 block size 8, and then here's how we get batch.  For any arbitrary split it. Split is a training split. Then we're going to look at Trend data otherwise and valdia.  That gets us, the data array. And then when I generate a random positions to grab a chunk out of  I actually grabbed I actually generate batch size number of  Random offsets.  So because this is 4, we are IX is going to be a four numbers that are randomly generated between 0 and Len of data minus block size. So it's just random, offsets into the training set.  and then access, as I explained are the first block size character's starting at I  The Y's are the offset by one of that. So just add plus one.  And then we're going to get those chunks for every one of integers. I in IX and use a torch dot stack to take all those one-dimensional tensors as we saw here.  And we're going to stack them up.  As rows.  And so, they all become a row in a four by eight tensor. So here's what I'm printing, then.  When I sample, a batch XP and wybie.  the inputs, the Transformer now are  the input X is the 4 by 8 tensor.  4 rows of 8 columns.  And each one of these is a chunk of the training set.  And then the targets here are in the associated array Y, and they will come in through the Transformer all the way at the end to create the loss function. So they will give us the correct answer for every single position inside X.  And then these are the four independent rows.  so, spelled out as we did before,  This four by eight, array contains a total of 32 examples and they're completely independent as far as the Transformers concerned.  so, when the  Input is 24, the target is 43 or rather 43 here in the Y array. When the input is 2443, the target is 58.  When the input is 244358, the target is 5 Etc.  Or like when it is a 5258 one. The target is 508. Right? So, you can sort of see this spelled out. These are the 32 independent examples packed in to a single batch of the input X and then the desired targets are in y.  And so now this integer tensor of X is going to feed into the Transformer.  And that Transformer is going to simultaneously process, all these examples. And then look up the correct integers to predict in every one of these positions in the tensor. Why? Okay? So now that we have our batch of input that we'd like to feed into a Transformer. Let's start basically feeding this into neural networks.  Now we're going to start off with the simplest possible neural network which in the case of language modeling in my opinion is the background language model and we've covered the background language model in my, make more series in a lot of depth.  And so here, I'm going to sort of go faster and let's just Implement by torch module directly that implements by Graham language model.  so, I'm importing the pytorch and in module,  For reproducibility.  And then here, I'm constructing a Bagram language model, which is a subclass of an module.  And then I'm calling it and I'm passing in the inputs and targets. I'm just printing.  Now when the inputs and targets come here, you see that, I'm just taking the index the inputs X here, which I renamed to idx and I'm just passing them into this token embedding table.  So it's going on here. Is that here in the Constructor?  We are creating a token embedding table.  And it is of size vocab size by vocab size.  And we're using an indot embedding which is a very thin wrapper around basically, a tensor of shape vocab size by vocab size.  And what's happening here is that when we pass idx here, every single integer in our input is going to refer to this embedding table and is going to block out a row of that embedding table corresponding to its index.  So 24, here will go to the embedding table and will pluck out the 24th row.  And then 43 will go here and block out the 43rd row Etc. And then pytorch is going to arrange all of this into a batch by Time by Channel. Tensor, in this case, back is 4, time is 8 and C, which is the channels is vocab size or 65.  And so we're just going to block out all those rows arranged them in a Beat by T by sea. And now we're going to interpret this as the logits which are basically the scores for the next character in a sequence. And so, what's happening here is we are predicting, what comes next based on just the individual identity of a single token and you can do that because I mean, currently, the tokens are not talking to each other, and they're not seeing any context, except for they're just seeing themselves. So I'm a token number five and then I can actually make pretty decent predictions about what comes next just by knowing that I'm token 5 because some characters know certain follow other characters in typical scenarios. So we saw a lot of this in a lot more depth in the make more series and here if I just run this, then we currently get the predictions, the scores, the logits.  For every one of the four by eight positions not that we've made predictions about what comes next. We'd like to evaluate the Lost function and so in make more series we saw that a good way to measure a loss or like a quality of the predictions is to use the negative log likelihood loss which is also implemented in pytorch under the name cross entropy  so, what we'd like to do here is  Loss is the cross entropy on the predictions and the targets. And so this measures the quality of the logic's with respect to the targets. In other words we have the identity of the next character. So how well are we predicting the next character based on the logic's and intuitively? The correct? The correct dimension of logits  depending on whatever the target is, should have a very high number and all the other dimensions should be very low number, right?  Now, the issue is that this won't actually, this is what we want. We want to basically output loads and the loss.  This is what we want, but unfortunately, this won't actually run.  We get an error message, but intuitively. We want to  measure this. Now when we go to the pytorch Cross entropy  At the documentation here.  We're trying to call the cross entropy and it's functional form. So that means we don't have to create like a module for it.  But here, when we go to the documentation, you have to look into the details of how to torture expects, these inputs. And basically the issue here is my torch expects, if you have multi-dimensional input, which we do because we have a bee by T by censor, then it actually really wants the channels to be the second dimension here. so if you so basically it wants a bead by C by T instead of a b by T by C,  And so it just the details of how pytorch treats.  These kinds of inputs and so we don't actually want to deal with that. So we're going to do instead is we need to basically reshape our loads.  So, here's where I like to do. I like, to take basically give names to the dimensions, so, launches that shape is made by T by C and unpack those numbers.  And then let's say that logits equals.  And we want to be a b time c b times C by C. So just a two-dimensional array.  Right? So we're going to take all the  we're going to take all of these.  Positions here and we're going to stretch them out in a one-dimensional sequence.  And preserve the channel Dimension, as the second dimension.  So we're just kind of like stretching out the array so it's two dimensional and in that case, it's going to better conform to apply torch sort of expects in its dimensions.  Now, we have to do the same to targets because currently targets.  Are of shape B by T and we want to be just B times D. So one dimensional. Now alternatively you could always still just do minus 1 because pytorch will guess what? This should be if you want to lay it out but let me just be explicit and say a few times t  Once we reshape this, it will match the cross-entropy case and then we should be able to evaluate our loss.  okay, so that right now and we can  Do loss. And So currently, we see that the loss is 4.87.  Now, because our we have 65 possible, vocabulary elements, we can actually guess at what the Lost should be.  And in particular, we covered negative log likelihood. In a lot of detail, we are expecting log or lawn of 1 over 65 and negative of that.  So we're expecting the lost to be about 4.1 to 17 but we're going to 4.87. And so that's telling us that the initial prediction is not super diffuse. They've got a little bit of entropy and so we're guessing wrong.  So yes but actually we're able to evaluate the loss. Okay. So now that we can evaluate the quality of the model on some data we'd like to also be able to generate from the model. So let's do the generation. Now I'm going to go again a little bit faster here because I covered all this already in previous videos. so,  here's a generate function for the model.  so we take some, we take the same kind of input idx here,  and basically,  This is the current context of some characters in a batch in some batch.  So it's also B by T and the job of generate is to basically take this B by T and extend it to be B by T plus 1 plus 2 plus 3. And so it's just basically it continues the generation in all the batch dimensions in the time dimension.  So that's its job and it will do that for Max new tokens.  So you can see here on the bottom, there's going to be some stuff here, but on the bottom, whatever is predicted is concatenated on top of the previous idx.  Along the First Dimension, which is the time to mention to create the B by T plus one.  So that becomes a new idea X. So the job of generate is to take a b by T and make it a b by T plus one plus two plus three.  As many as we want maximum tokens. So this is the generation from the mall.  Now, inside the generation. What are we doing? We're taking the current in the seats. We're getting the predictions. So we get. Those are on the logits. and then the loss here is going to be ignored because we're not we're not using that and we have no targets that are sort of ground, truth targets that we're going to be comparing with  then once we get the logits, we are only focusing on the last step. So instead of a b by T by T by C, we're going to pluck out the negative one. The last element in the time dimension  Because those are the predictions for. What? Comes next?  so that gives us the logits which we then convert to probabilities via softmax  And then we use multinomial to sample from those probabilities. And we asked by torch to give us one sample.  And so idx next will become a debug one because Niche, one of the batch Dimensions. We're going to have a single prediction for what comes next. So this number samples. Equals one will make this be a one.  And then we're going to take those integers that come from the sampling process. According to the probability distribution given here  and those integers got just concatenated on top of the current sort of like running stream of integers, and this gives us a PYT plus one.  And then we can return that.  Now one thing here is you see how I'm calling self of idx which will end up going to the forward function. I'm not providing any Targets. So currently this would give an error because targets is sort of not given. So tarkus has to be optional. So targets is none by default and then if targets is none, then there's no loss to create. So it's just loss is none. But else all of this happens and we can create a loss  so this will make it so,  If we have the targets, we provide them and get a loss. If we have no targets, it will just get the logits  So this here will generate from the model.  And let's take that for a right now.  So I have another code chunk here, which will generate for the model from the model and okay, this is kind of crazy. So maybe let me  Let me break this down.  So these are the idx, right?  I'm creating a batch we'll be just one time will be just one.  So, I'm creating a little one by one tensor and it's holding a zero.  And the d-type the data type is integer.  So 0 is going to be how we kick off the generation, and remember that 0 is, is the element a standing for a new line character. So it's kind of like a reasonable thing to to feed in as the very first character in a sequence to be the new one. Um so it's going to be idx, which we're going to feed in here. Then we're going to ask for 100 tokens.  And then end, that generate will continue that.  Now, because generate works on the level of batches. We end up, we then have to index into this 0th row to basically unplug the  The single Bosch Dimension that exists.  and then that gives us a  Time steps, just a one-dimensional array of all the indices which we will convert to simple python list.  From pytorch tensor, so that that compete into our decode function and convert those into integers into text.  So, let me bring this back and we're generating 100 tokens, what's run?  And here's the generation that we achieved.  So obviously as garbage and the reason it's garbage is because this is totally random model. So next up, we're going to want to train this model.  Now, one more thing I wanted to point out here is  this function is written to be General but it's kind of like ridiculous right now because  We're feeding in oldest, we're building out this context and we're concatenating it all, and we're always feeding it all into the model. But that's kind of ridiculous because this is just a simple diagram model. So to make, for example, this prediction about K, we only needed this W but actually what we fed into the model is we fed the entire sequence and then we only looked at the very last piece and predicted k.  So the only reason I'm riding it in this way is because right now, this is a biograph model, but I'd like to keep this function fixed and I'd like it to work later when our character is actually, basically look further in the history. And so right now, the history is not used. So this looks silly but eventually the history will be used and so that's why we want to do it this way. So just a quick comment on that.  So now we see that this is random. So let's train the model. So we become a bit lost random. Okay, let's not trained the model. So first what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a pytorch optimization object.  So, here we are using the optimizer.  Adam W. Now in the make more series, we've only ever used to castigating descent the simplest possible Optimizer, which you can get using the SGD instead. But I want to use atom, which is a much more advanced and popular Optimizer and it works. Extremely well for typical good setting. For learning rate is roughly three negative four. But for very, very small networks. Like the case here, you can get away with much much higher learning rates wanting negative 3 or even higher. Probably, But let me create the optimizer object.  Which will be the gradients and update the parameters. Using the gradients.  and then here,  our batch size up above was only four. So, let me actually use something bigger. Let's say, 32, and then for some number of steps, we are sampling, a new batch of data where evaluating the loss where zuring out all the gradients from the previous step. Getting the gradients for all the parameters and then using those gradients to update our parameters. So typical training loop. As we saw in the make more series,  So, let me now run this.  For say, 100 iterations and let's see what kind of losses we're going to get.  So, we started around 4.7.  And now we're getting to lock 4.6, 4.5, Etc. So the implementation is definitely happening but  Let's sort of try to increase the number of iterations and only printed at the end.  Because we probably will not train for longer.  okay, so we're down to 3.6 roughly  roughly down to three.  This is the most janky optimization. Okay, it's working. Let's just do 10,000.  And then from here, we want to copy this.  And hopefully we're going to get something reasonable and of course it's not going to be Shakespeare from my grand model. But at least we see that the loss is improving and hopefully we're expecting something a bit more reasonable.  Okay, so our downloaded about 2.5 ish, let's see what we get.  Okay.  Dramatic improvements. Certainly on what we had here.  So, let me just increase the number of tokens.  okay, so we see that we're starting to get something at least like  reasonable ish.  Certainly not Shakespeare, but the model is making progress so that is the simplest possible model.  so now what I'd like to do is  obviously that this is a very simple model because the tokens are not talking to each other. So give them the previous contacts of whatever was generated. We're only looking at the very last character to make the predictions about what comes next. So now, these now, these tokens have to start talking to each other and figuring out what is in the context so that they can make better predictions for what comes next? And this is how we're gonna kick off the Transformer, okay? So next, I picked the code that we developed in this jupyter notebook. And I converted it to be a script, And I'm doing this because I just want to simplify our intermediate work into just the final product that we have at this point.  So, in the top here, I put all the hyper parameters that we defined. I introduced a few and I'm going to speak to that in orbit.  otherwise a lot of this should be recognizable, reproducibility  Read data, get the encoder and the decoder. Create the train and test splits.  I use the kind of like data loader that gets a batch of the inputs and targets.  This is new and I'll talk about it in a second.  Now, this is the background language model that we developed.  and it can forward and give us a loads and loss and can generate  And then, here we are creating the optimizer, and this is the training Loop.  So everything here should look pretty familiar. Now, some of the small things that I added. Number one,  I added the ability to run on a GPU if you have it. So if you have a GPU then you can this will use Cuda instead of just CPU. And everything will be a lot more faster. Now when device becomes Cuda, then we need to make sure that when we load the data we move it to device.  When we create the model, we want to move the model parameters to device. So as an example, here, we have the in an embedding table and it's got a DOT weight inside it, which stores the sort of look up table, so that would be moved to the GPU. So that all the calculations here happen on the GPU and they can be a lot faster. And then finally here when I'm creating the context that feeds into generate, I have to make sure that I create on the device.  Number two, what I introduced is.  the fact that here in the training Loop,  Here, I was just printing the last that item.  inside the training Loop, but this is a very noisy measurement of the current loss, because every batch will be more or less lucky  And so, what I want to do usually is I have an estimate loss function and the estimated loss basically then goes up here.  And it averages up the laws over multiple batches.  So in particular we're going to iterate evaluator times and we're going to basically get our loss and then we're going to get the average loss for both splits and so this will be a lot less noisy.  So here, when we call the estimate loss, we're going to report the pretty accurate train and validation loss.  Now, when we come back up, you'll notice a few things here, I'm setting the model to evaluation phase and down here. I'm resetting it back to training phase. Now, right now for our model, as this, this doesn't actually do anything because the only thing inside this model is this and then dot embedding. And this, this network would behave, both would be have the same in both evaluation mode and training mode, we have no Dropout layers, we have no batch Norm layers, Etc, but it is a good practice to Think Through what mode, your neural network is in because some layers will have different Behavior at inference time or training time.  and,  There's a contact manager, torched up, no grad. And this is just telling pytorch that everything that happens inside this function, we will not call that backward on. And so back to be a lot more efficient with its memory use because it doesn't have to store all the intermediate variables because we're never going to call backward and so it can be a lot more memory efficient in that way. So a good practice to tell by torch when we don't intend to do back propagation.  So right now, the script is about 120 lines of code of and that's kind of our starter code. I'm calling it background that pie and I'm going to release it later.  Now, running this script gives us output in the terminal and it looks something like this. It basically, as I ran this code, it was giving me the train loss and vowel loss and we see that we convert to somewhere around 2.5.  With the pyramid model and then, here's the sample that we produced at the end.  And so we have everything packaged up in the script, and we're in a good position now to iterate on this. Okay, so we are almost ready to start writing our very first self-attention block for processing. These tokens  Now, before we actually get there, I want to get you used to a mathematical trick that is used in the self attention inside a Transformer and is really just like at the heart of an efficient implementation of self-attention.  And so I want to work with this toy example to just get to use to this operation and then it's going to make it much more clear once we actually get to to it in the script again.  so let's create a bee by T by C, where btnc are just four eight and two in the story example  and these are basically channels and we have batches and we have the time component and we have some information at each point in the sequence. So see  now what we would like to do is we would like these tokens. So we've up to eight tokens here in a batch in these eight tokens are currently not talking to each other and we would like them to talk to each other. We'd like to couple them. And in particular we don't we we want to couple them in this very specific way. So the token for example at the 5th location, it should not communicate with tokens in the 6th 7th and 8th vocation.  Because those are future tokens in the sequence.  the token on the fifth location should only talk to the one in the fourth, third second, and first  So it's only so information, only flows from previous contacts to the current time step and we cannot get any information from the future because we are about to try to predict the future.  so,  What is the easiest way for tokens to communicate? Okay. The easiest way I would say is. Okay, if we are up to if we're a fifth token and I'd like to communicate with my past, the simplest way we can do that is to just do a weight is to just do an average of all the all the preceding elements. So for example, if I'm the fifth token, I would like to take the channels that make up that are information at my step, but then all the channels from the fourth step. Third step, second, step in the first step. I like to average those up. And then, that would become sort of like a feature Vector that summarizes me in the context of my history. Now of course just doing a sum or like an average is an extremely weak form of interaction. Like this communication is extremely lossy, we've lost a ton of information about the spatial Arrangements of all those tokens, but that's okay. For now we'll see how we can bring that information back later.  for now, we would like to do is  for every single batch element independently.  For every teeth token in that sequence we'd like to now calculate the average of all the vectors in all the previous tokens. And also at this token  So, let's write that out.  I have a small snippet here and instead of just fumbling around on, let me just copy paste it and talk to it.  So, in other words, we're going to create X.  and B, O W is short for backup reports, because backwards is is kind of like,  A term that people use when you are just averaging up things. So this is just a bag of words. Basically there's a word stored on every one of these eight locations and we're doing a bag of words so just averaging.  So in the beginning we're going to say that it's just initialized at 0 and then I'm doing a for Loop here so we're not being efficient yet, that's coming. But for now, we're just iterating over all the best dimensions in the penalty it rating over time. And then the previous tokens are at this batch Dimension and then everything up to and including the teeth token, okay?  So when we slice out X in this way, XP Becomes of shape. How many elements that were in the past. And then, of course, C. So all the two-dimensional information from these little tokens.  So that's the previous sort of chunk of tokens.  From my current sequence.  And then I'm just doing the average or the mean over the 0 Dimensions. So I'm averaging out the time here.  And I'm just going to get a little c. One dimensional Vector, which I'm going to store in X backwards.  so I can run this and this is not going to be very informative because  let's see. So this is x sub 0. So this is the 0th batch element and then expo at 0. Now,  you see how the at the first location here? You see that the two are equal and that's because it's just doing an average of this one token.  But here, this one is now an average of these two. And now this one is an average of these three.  And so on.  So and this last one is the average of all of these elements. So vertical average, just averaging up all the tokens now gives this outcome here.  So this is all well and good, but this is very inefficient. Now, the trick is that we can be very, very efficient about doing this using matrix multiplication.  So that's the mathematical trick and let me show you what I mean. Let's work with the toy example here.  Let me run it, and I'll explain.  I have a simple Matrix here that is three by three of all ones.  A matrix B of just random numbers and it's a 3 by 2.  And a matrix C, which will be three by three multiply 3 by 2 which will give out a three by two.  So here we're just using.  Matrix multiplication.  So, a multiplied B gives us C.  Okay, so how are these numbers in C achieved, right? So this number in the top left, is the first troll of a DOT product with the First Column of B.  and since all the row of a right now is all just once, Than the dot product here. With, with this column of B is just going to do a sum of these of this column. So 2 plus 6, plus 6 is 14.  The element here in the output of C is also the first column here, the first row of a multiplied. Now with the second column of B so 7 plus 4 plus plus 5 is 16  Now you see that there's repeating elements here. So this 14 again is because this rose again all ones and it's multiplying the First Column of B so we get 14.  And this one is and so on. So this last number here is the last row dot product, last column.  now, the trick here is the following  This is just a boring number of is just a boring array of all ones, but torch has this function called Trill, which is short for a triangular.  So something like that and you can wrap it in to once and we'll just return the lower triangular portion of this.  Okay.  So now it will basically 0 out these guys here so we just get the lower triangular part. Well, what happens if we do that?  So now we'll have a like this and be like this. And what are we getting here and see? Well, what is this number? Well, this is the first row times the First Column and because this is 0  These elements here are now ignored. So we just get it 2.  And then this number here is the first row times the second column. And because these are 0s, they get ignored and it's just 7 the 7 multiplies. This one  But look what happened here because this is one and then 0, we what ended up happening is we're just plucking out the row of this row of B and that's what we got.  Now, here we have one one zero.  So here, one one zero dot product. With these two columns will not give us two plus six, which is 8 and sum of plus 4, which is 11  And because this is one one, we ended up with the addition of all of them.  And so basically, depending on how many once and 0 is, we have here, we are basically doing a sum currently of the variable number of these rows and that gets deposited into C.  So currently we're doing some because these are ones, but we can also do average, right? And you can start to see how we could do average of the rows of B sort of incremental, fashion. Because we don't have to. We can basically normalize these rows so that they sum to one, and then we're going to get an average.  so if we took a and then we did a equals a divided  A torch that sum.  in the  Of a in the month.  Dimension and then let's keep them as true.  So therefore, the broadcasting will work out.  So if I rerun this, you see now that these rows now some to one. So this row is one this row is 0.5 is 0 and here we get 1/3  And now when we do a multiplied B, what are we getting?  Here we are just getting the first row first row.  Here. Now, we are getting the average of the first two rows.  Okay, so two and six, average is four and four and seven averages 5.5.  And on the bottom here, where are now getting the average of these three rows?  So the average of all of elements of B, now the positive here and so you can see that by manipulating these elements of this multiplying Matrix and then multiplying it with any given Matrix. We can do these averages in this incremental fashion because we just get And we can manipulate that based on the elements of a, okay. So that's very convenient. So let's swing back up here and see how we can vectorize this and make it much more efficient using what we've learned.  so, in particular,  We are going to produce an array a but here, I'm going to call it way short for weights.  but this is our a  and this is how much of every row we want to average up, and it's going to be an average because you can see that these rows sum to one,  so this is our a and then our B in this example, of course, is  X.  So it's going to happen here now is that we are going to have an expo too.  And this Expo, two is going to be way multiplying.  RX.  So let's think this through way is T by T, and this is Matrix. Multiplying in pytorch, a b by T by C.  And it's giving us.  Different. What shape. So pytorch will come here. And we'll see that these shapes are not the same, so it will create a batch Dimension here.  and this is a bashed Matrix multiply  and so it will apply this matrix multiplication in all the batch elements in parallel. And individually. And then for each batch element, there will be a t by T, multiplying T by C. Exactly. As we had below,  so, this will now create  B by T by C.  And xbot 2 will now become identical to Expo.  So,  we can see that torch.all close.  Of Expo and Expo 2 should be true.  Now.  so this kind of like misses us that these are in fact the same  so Expo and Expo 2, if I just print them,  Okay, or not going to be able to. Okay, we're not gonna be able to just stare down but  Let me try Expo. This will just at the 0th element and Expo, two at the 0 element. So just the first batch. And we should see that this and that should be identical, which they are  Right? So what happened here? The trick is we were able to use batched Matrix multiply  To do this aggregation really and it's a weighted aggregation in the weights are specified in this, T by T, array. and we're basically doing weighted sums and these weighted sums are according to the weights inside here but take on sort of this triangular form  And so that means that a token at the teeth Dimension will only get sort of information from the tokens perceiving it. So that's exactly what we want. And finally, I would like to rewrite it in one more way.  And we're going to see what that's useful.  So this is the third version and it's also identical to the first and second, but let me talk through it. It uses softmax.  so,  Trail here.  Is this Matrix lower triangular ones?  Way begins as all zero.  Okay, so if I just print way in the beginning, it's all 0.  Then I use.  Masked film.  so what this is doing is  wait, that masked Phil, it's all zeros and I'm saying,  For all the elements who are Trill is equal to 0.  Make them be negative Infinity.  So all the elements were Trill is 0 will become negative Infinity. Now  So this is what we get. and then, the final one here is softmax  so if I take a soft Max along every single, so dim is -1 so long, every single row  If I do a softmax, what does that going to do?  Well, softmax is  Is also like a normalization operation, right?  And so spoiler alert, you get the exact same Matrix.  Line, bring back the soft, Max.  And recall that in softmax, we're going to exponentiate every single one of these.  And then we're going to divide by the sum.  And so for if we exponentiate every single element here, we're going to get a one and here we're going to get a zero zero zero, zero, zero everywhere else.  And then when we normalize we just get one here. We're going to get one one and then 0's and then softmax will again divide and this will give us 0.5 and so on.  And so, this is also the same way to produce this mask.  Now, the reason that this is a bit more interesting and the reason we're going to end up using it in South attention.  Is that?  These weights here, begin with 0 and you can think of this as like an interaction strength or like an affinity. So, basically, it's telling us how much of each token from the past, do we want to aggregate an average job?  And then this line is saying tokens from the past, cannot communicate by setting them to negative Infinity. We're saying that we will not aggregate anything from those tokens  And so basically this then goes through softmax and through the weighted and this is the aggregation, through matrix multiplication.  And so what this is now is you can think of these as these zeros are currently just set by us to be 0. But a quick preview is that these affinities between the tokens are not going to be just constant at 0. There going to be data dependent, best tokens are going to start looking at each other and some tokens will find other tokens more or less. Interesting.  And depending on what their values are, they're going to find each other interesting to different amounts and I'm going to call those affinities, I think.  And then here, we are saying the future cannot communicate with the past. We're going to clamp them.  And then when we normalize and sum, we're going to aggregate sort of their values depending on how interesting they find each other. And so that's the preview for self attention. And basically, long story short, from this entire section is that you can do weighted aggregations of your past elements.  By having by using matrix, multiplication of a lower triangular fashion.  And then the elements here, in the lower triangular part, are telling you how much of each element fuses into this position.  So we're going to use this trick now to develop the self-attention block. So first, let's get some quick preliminaries out of the way.  First, the thing I'm kind of bothered by is that you see how we're passing in vocab sized into the Constructor. There's no need to do that because we'll capsized is already defined up top as a global variable. So there's no need to pass this stuff around.  Next one, I want to do is I don't want to actually create. I want to create like a level of indirection here where we don't directly go to the embedding for the  Loads, but instead, we go through this intermediate phase because we're going to start making that bigger.  So let me introduce a new variable and embed, it short for number of embedding dimensions.  So, an embed.  Here.  Will be say 32 that was, this is just suggestion from GitHub copilot. By the way, it also suggested 32, which is a good number So, this is an embedding table and only 32 dimensional embeddings.  So then here this is not going to give us loads directly. Instead, this is going to give us token embeddings.  That's what I'm going to call it and then to go from the token emitting to the logits. We're going to need a linear layer.  So self-doubt LM head, let's call it short for language, modeling head.  Is ending linear from an embed up to woke up size.  And then we swing over here. We're actually going to get the low Jets by exactly what the copilot says.  Now, we have to be careful here because this C, and this C are not equal.  This is an mbed C, and this is Will capsize.  So let's just say that an embed is equal to C.  And then this just creates one spurious layer of interaction through a linear layer.  But the should be run.  so, we see that this runs and  This currently looks kind of spurious but we're going to build on top of this. Now next up so far we've taken these and in the seas and we've encoded them based on the identity of the tokens inside idea, X. The next thing that people very often do is that we're not just encoding the identity of these tokens but also their position.  So we're going to have a second position embedding table here, so solve that position embedding table.  Is an embedding of block size by an embed.  And so each position from 0 to block size, minus 1 will also get its own embedding vector.  And then here, first, let me decode B by T, from idx, dot shape.  And then here, we're also going to have a positive bedding, which is the positional embedding. And these are this is torch arranged.  So this will be basically just integers from 0 to T minus 1.  and all of those integers from 0 to 10 - 1 get embedded through the table, to create the T by C,  and then here this gets renamed to just say x and x will be  The addition of the token embeddings would the positional embeddings?  And here the broth, casting note will work out. So B by T by C plus T by C. This gets right aligned a new dimension of one gets added and it gets broadcasted across batch.  So at this point x holds not just the token identities but the positions, at which these still can occur. And this is currently not that useful because of course, we just have a simple diagram model so it doesn't matter. If you're on the fifth position, the second position or wherever it's all translation in variant at this stage, so this information currently wouldn't help. But as we work on the self potential block, we'll see that this starts to matter.  Okay, so now we get the Crux of self-attention. So this is probably the most important part of this video to understand.  We're going to implement a small self-attention for a single individual head as they're called.  So we start off with where we were, so all of this code is familiar.  So right now, I'm working with an example where I change number of channels from 2 to 32. So we have a 4 by 8 arrangement of tokens and each token. And the information at each token is currently 32 dimensional but we just are working with random numbers.  now, we saw here that  The code as we had it before, does a simple weight simple average of all the past tokens and the current token. So, it's just the previous information. And current information is just being mixed together in an average.  And that's what this code currently achieves. And it does so by creating this lower triangular structure, which allows us to mask, out this way Matrix that we create So we mask it out and then we normalize it and currently when we initialize the affinities between all the different sort of tokens or nodes, I'm going to use those terms interchangeably.  so, when we initialize the affinities between all the different tokens to be zero,  then we see that way gives us this structure, where every single row has these  Uniform numbers. And so that's what that's what then in this Matrix. Multiply makes it so that we're doing a simple operator.  Now.  We don't actually want this to be.  All Uniform because different tokens will find different, other tokens more or less interesting. And we want that to be dated dependent. So for example, if I'm a vowel, then maybe I'm looking for consonants in my past and maybe I want to know what those costs are. And I want that information to Flow To Me.  And so I want to now gather information from the past but I want to do it in a date independent way and this is the problem itself. Attention solves.  Now the way self potential solves, this is the following every single node or single token at each position will emit two vectors. It will emit a query and it will emit a key.  Now the query Vector roughly speaking is, what am I looking for?  And the key Vector roughly speaking is, what do I contain?  And then the way we get affinities between these tokens now in a sequence,  Is we basically just do a DOT product between the keys and the queries.  So my query dot products with all the keys of all the other tokens and that dot product now becomes way.  And so if the key and the query are sort of aligned, they will interact to a very high amount and then I will get to learn more about that specific token as a post to any other token in a sequence. So let's implement this stop.  We're going to implement a single.  What's called head of self attention?  So this is just one head, there's a hyper parameter involved with these heads, which is the head size.  And then here, I'm initializing the linear modules and I'm using bicycle Sports. So these are just going to apply a matrix multiply with some fixed weights. and now, let me produce a  Key and Q, okay? And Q by forwarding these modules on x.  So, the size of this will not become  B by T by 16, because that is the head size and the same here. B by T by 16.  So, this being the bad size.  So you see here that when I forward this linear on top of my ex all the tokens in all the positions in the B, by T Arrangement, all of them in parallel and independently produce a key and a query. So no. Communication has happened yet.  But the communication comes, now all the queries will dot product with all the keys.  So basically what we want is we want weigh now or the Affinity between these to be query. Multiplying key.  But we have to be careful with. We can't Matrix multiply this. We actually need to transpose K but we have to be careful because these are when you have the batch Dimension. So in particular we want to transpose the last two Dimensions Dimension, negative one, and the mission native to So -2 negative 1.  And so this Matrix, multiply now will be the following B by T by 16.  Matrix multiplies B by 16 by T to give us.  B by T by T.  Right.  So for every row of B, we're not going to have a t-square matrix giving us the affinities. And these are now the way  So they're not zeros, they are not coming from this. Dot product, between the keys and the queries.  So this can now run. I can run this.  And the way to aggregation now is a function in a data, pandem manner between the keys and queries of these notes.  So just inspecting, what happened here.  The way takes on the form.  And you see that before way was just a constant. So it was applied in the same way to all the batch elements. But now, every single batch elements will have different sort of way, because every single batch element contains different tokens and different positions. And so this is not dated dependent  so when we look at just these 0th Row, for example in the input, These are the weights that came out so you can see now that they're not just exactly uniform.  And in particular as an example here, for the last row, this was the 8th token and the 8th token knows what content it has and it knows at what position it's in.  And now the a token based on that.  Creates a query. Hey, I'm looking for this kind of stuff. I'm a vowel, I'm on the 8th position. I'm looking for any consonants at positions up to four.  And then all the nodes get to emit keys.  And maybe one of the channels could be, I am I am a consonant and I am in the position up to four.  And that key would have a high number in that specific Channel. And that's how the query and the key. When they dot product, they can find each other and create a high affinity.  And when they have a high Affinity like say this token was pretty interesting to to this eighth token.  When they have a high Affinity, then through the softmax, I will end up aggregating a lot of its information into my position.  And so I'll get to learn a lot about it.  Now, just this, we're looking at way after this is already happened. um,  let me erase this operation as well. So let me erase the masking and the softmax just to show you the under the hood internals and how that works.  So without the masking, and the softmax way comes out like this, right? This is the outputs of the dot product.  And these are the raw outputs and they take on values from negative, you know, to, to positive 2 Etc.  So, that's the raw interactions and raw affinities between all the nodes.  But now, if I'm a, if I'm a fifth node, I will not want to aggregate anything from the six notes and node, and the eight node. So, actually, we use the upper triangular masking.  So those are not a lot to communicate.  And now we actually want to have a nice distribution so we don't want to aggregate negative 0.1 of this note. That's crazy. So as we exponentiate and normalize,  And now we get a nice distribution that Sims to one.  And this is telling us now on the date of dependent manner. How much of information to aggregate from any of these tokens in the past?  So that's way and it's not 0 anymore, right? But it's calculated in this way. Now there's one more part to a single salvation head. And that is that when we do the aggregation, we don't actually aggregate the tokens. Exactly, we aggregate. We produce one more value here, and we call that the value, So in the same way that we produced p and query, we're also going to create a value.  and then,  Here.  We don't aggregate.  X, we calculate a v which is just achieved by propagating this linear on top of X again and then we  output way multiplied by V. So V is the elements that we aggregate or the the vector that we aggregate is the raw X.  And now, of course, this will make it so that the output here of the single head will be 16 dimensional because that is the head size.  So you can think of X as kind of like private information to this token if you if you think about it that way. So X is kind of private to this token. So I'm a fifth token at some and some identity and my information is kept in Vector X.  And now for the purposes of the single head, here's what I'm interested in, here's what I have.  and if you find me, interesting, here's what I will communicate to you and that's stored in the  And so V is the thing that gets aggregated for the purposes of this single head between the different notes. and that's  Basically the self-attention mechanism. This is, this is what it does.  There are a few notes that I would make, like, to make about attention. Number one, attention is a communication mechanism, you can really think about it, as a communication mechanism, where you have a number of nodes in a directed graph, where basically you have edges point in between those like this.  And what happens is every node has some Vector of information and it gets to aggregate information via a weighted sum from all of those that point to it.  And this is done in a data dependent manner. So depending on whatever data is actually stored at each node at any point in time.  Now.  Our graph doesn't look like this, our graph has a different structure. We have eight nodes because the block size is 8, and there's always 8 talk to tokens.  And the first node is only pointed to by itself. The second node is pointed to by the first node end itself all the way up to the 8th node, which is pointed to by all the previous nodes and itself.  And so that's structured that our directed graph has or happens happens to have in order of sort of scenario like language modeling, but in principle attention can be applied to any arbitrary directed graph, and it's just a communication mechanism between the notes. The second note is that, notice that there is no notion of space, so attention simply acts over, like a set of vectors in this graph. And so, by default these notes have no idea where they are positioned in the space. And that's why we need to encode them positionally and sort of give them some information that is anchors to a specific position. So that they sort of know where they are. And this is different than, for example, from convolution, because if you run for example, a convolution operation number, some input. There is a very specific sort of layout of the information in space and the convolutional filters of act and space. And so it's, it's not like inattention in attention is just a set of vectors out there in space, they communicate. And if you want them to have a notion of space, you need to specifically add it, which is what we've done. When we calculated the relative, the positional encode encodings and added that information to the vectors. The next thing that I hope is very clear is that the elements across the batch Dimension, which are independent examples, never talk to each other.  They're always processed independently and this is a bashed Matrix. Multiply that applies, basically a matrix multiplication kind of Imperial across the batch Dimension so maybe would be more accurate to say that in this analogy of a directed graph. We really have because the baptized is 4, we really have four separate pools of eight nodes and those eight nodes only talk to each other. But in total does like 32 knows that are being processed but there's sort of four separate pools of eight. You can look at that way. the next note, is that here in the case of language modeling,  we have this specific structure of directed graph, where the future tokens will not communicate to the Past tokens.  But this doesn't necessarily have to be the constraint and the general case and in fact in many cases, you may want to have all of the nodes talk to each other fully. So as an example, if you're doing sentiment analysis or something like that, where the Transformer you might have a number of tokens and you may want to have them all talk to each other fully because later you are predicting, for example, the sentiment of the sentence. And so it's okay for these notes to talk to each other.  And so, in those cases, you will use an encoder block of self-attention. And all it means that it's an encoder block, is that you will delete this line of code allowing all the nose to completely talk to each other.  What we're implementing here is sometimes called a decoder block and it's called the decoder because it is sort of like decoding language. And it's got this Auto regressive format where you have to mask with the triangle and Matrix. So that notes from the future, never talked to the Past because they would give away the answer. And so basically an encoder blocks you would delete this allow all the nodes to talk in decoder blocks. This will always be present so that you have this triangular structure, but both are allowed and attention, doesn't care. Attention supports arbitrary connectivity between nodes.  The next thing I wanted to comment on is you keep me? You keep hearing me, say attention self-attention, Etc. There's actually also something called cross attention, what is the difference. So basically the reason this attention is self-attention is because the keys queries and the values are all coming from the same Source from X. So the same Source X produces keys and values. So these nodes are self-attacking, but Imperial attention is much more General than that. So for example, an encoder decoder Transformers,  you can have a case where the queries are produced from X, but the keys and the values come from a whole separate, external source, and sometimes from encoder blocks that encode, some complex that we'd like to condition on. And so the keys in the values will actually come from a whole separate Source, those are nodes on the side. And here we're just producing queries and we're reading off information from the side.  So cross attention is used when there is a separate source of nodes. We'd like to pull information from into our nodes and it's self potential. If we just have nodes that would like to look at each other and talk to each other. So, this attention here, happens to be self-attention.  but in principle,  Attention is a lot more General, okay. In the last note that this stage is, if we come to the attention is only need paper here, we've already implemented attention. So given query key and value. We've multiplied the query on the key  We've soft maxed it and then we are aggregating the values.  There's one more thing that we're missing here which is the dividing by one of our square root of the head size. The DK here is the head size  Why aren't they doing this one? Is this important?  So they call the scaled attention.  and it's kind of like an important normalization basically have  The problem is, if you have unit gaussian inputs, so 0 mean, unit variance, okay? And QR unit gaussian then, if you just do way naively, then you see that your way actually will be the variance will be on the order of head size, which in our case is 16,  but if you multiply by one of her head size square root, so this is square root and this is one over.  Then the variance of wave will be one. So we'll be preserved.  Now, why is this important? You'll notice that way here.  Will feed into softmax. And so it's really important, especially at initialization that way be fairly diffused.  So in our case here, we sort of locked out here and way.  At a fairly diffused numbers here. So like this. Now, the problem is that because of softmax if weight takes on very positive and very negative numbers inside, it softmax will actually converge towards one hot vectors.  And so I can illustrate that here.  We are applying softmax to a tensor of values that are very close to 0. Then we're going to get a diffuse thing out of softmax.  But the moment I take these exact same thing and I start sharpening it, making it bigger by multiplying. These numbers, by 8. For example, you'll see that the softmax will start to sharpen and in fact, it will sharpen towards the max. So it will sharpen to words. Whatever number here, is the highest  And so basically we don't want these values to be too extremely initialization, otherwise softmax will be way too peaky and you're basically aggregating information from like a single node, every node, just Aggregates information from a single other node. That's not what we want that's initialization. And so the scaling is used just to control the variance at initialization, okay? So having said all that, let's not take our self potential knowledge and let's take it for spin. So here in the code, I created this head module and implements a single head of self-attention.  So you give it a head size, and then here, it creates the key query and the value linear layers. Typically people don't use biases in these.  So, those are the linear projections that we're going to apply to all of our nodes.  Now, here I'm creating this Trill variable Trill is not a parameter of the module. So in sort of pytorch naming conventions, this is called a buffer. It's not a parameter and you have to call it, you have to assign it to the module, using a register buffer. So that creates the trill,  The trying lower triangular Matrix.  And when we're given the input X, this should look very familiar. Now we calculated the keys, the queries, we calling the attention scores inside way.  We normalize it. So we're using scale attention here.  Then we make sure that sure doesn't communicate with the past. So this makes it a decoder block.  And then softmax and then aggregate the value and output.  Then here in the language model. I'm creating a head in the Constructor and I'm calling itself, attention head and the head size. I'm going to keep as the same and embed just for now And then here, once we've encoded the information with the token embeddings and the position embeddings or simply going to feed it into the self-attention head and then the output of that is going to go into the decoder language, modeling head, and create the logits. So this sort of the simplest way to plug in a self-attention component into our Network right now.  I had to make one more change, which is that here?  In the generate we have to make sure that our idx that we feed into the model because now we're using positional embeddings we can never have more than block size coming in because if idx is more than block size than our position embedding table is going to run out of scope because it only has embeddings for up to block size.  And so, therefore, I added some code here to crop the context that we're going to feed into self.  So that we never passed in more than block size elements. So those are the changes and let's now trained the network. Okay, so I also came up to the script here and I decreased the learning rate because the self-attention can't tolerate very, very high learning rates. And then I also increased number of iterations because the learning rate is lower, and then I trained it. And previously we were only able to get to up to 2.5. And now we are down to 2.4. So we definitely see a little bit of improvement from 2.5 to 2.4 roughly, but the text is still not amazing. So clearly the sulf attention had is doing some useful communication, but we still have a long way to go. Okay, so now we've implemented the scale dot product attention. Now next up in the attention is all you need paper. There's something called multi-head attention and what is multi-head attention, it's just applying multiple attention in parallel and concatenating their results.  So they have a little bit of diagram here. I don't know if this is super clear, it's really just multiple attention in parallel.  So let's Implement that fairly straightforward.  If we want a multi-head attention, then we will multiple heads of self-attention running in parallel.  so impactor we can do this by simply creating multiple hands, So however heads how many, how many heads you want and then what is the head size of each?  And then we run all of them in parallel into a list and simply concatenate all of the outlets.  And we're concatenating over the channel dimension.  So, the way this looks now is we don't have just a single attention.  that has hit size of 32 because remember, and embed is 32  instead of having one Communication channel, we now have four communication channels in parallel. And each one of these communication channels typically will be smaller correspondingly. So because we have four communication channels. We want 8, dimensional self attention. And so for each Communication channel, we're going to gather eight dimensional vectors. And then we have four of them and that Katniss to give us 32, which is the original. And in bed,  And so this is kind of similar to if you're familiar with convolutions this is kind of like a group convolution because basically instead of having one large convolution we do convolution in groups and that's multi-headed sulfate attention.  And so then here we just use essay heads, self attention heads instead. Now, actually ran it and scrolling down.  I ran the same thing and then we now get this out to 2.28. Roughly  And the output is still, the generation is still not amazing, but clearly, the validation loss is improving because we were at 2.4 just now.  And so, it helps to have multiple communication channels because obviously these tokens have a lot to talk about, they want to find the consonants, the vowels, they want to find the vowels, just from certain positions. They want to find any kinds of different things. And so it helps to create multiple independent channels of communication gather, lots of different types of data and then decode the output. Now, going back to the paper for a second. Of course, I didn't explain this figure in full detail, but we are starting to see some components of what we've already implemented. We have the positional encodings that add, we have the masked, multi-headed attention implemented.  Now here's another multi-headed attention, which is a cross attention to an encoder, which we haven't, we're not going to implement. In this case. I'm going to come back to that later.  But I want you to notice that there's a feet forward part here and then this is grouped into block that gets repeated and again.  Now the feet forward part. Here is just a simple multi-layer perceptron So, the multi-headed so here position y speed forward. Networks is just a simple little MLP.  So I want to start basically in a similar fashion also adding computation into the network.  And this computation is on the per node level.  so,  I've already implemented it and you can see the diff highlighted on the left here when I've added or changed things.  Now, before we had the multi-headed self attention, that did the communication, but we went way too fast to calculate the Logics, so the tokens looked at each other but didn't really have a lot of time to think on what they found from the other tokens.  And so what I've implemented here is a little feet forward single layer and there's little layer is just a linear followed by a relevant on Naruto and that's that's it.  So it's just a little later.  And then I call it feet forward.  And embed.  And then this feet forward is just called sequentially, right? After the self attention. So we self attend, then we feed forward and you'll notice that the feet forward here. When in supplying linear, this is on the per token level, all the tokens do this independently. So the Selva tension is the communication and then once they gather the data, now they need to think on that data individually. And so that's what feed forward is doing, and that's why I've added it here.  Now, when I train this, the validation law is actually continues to go down now to 2.24, which is down from 2.28, the output still look kind of terrible, but at least we've improved that situation.  and so, as a preview,  we're going to now start to intersperse the communication with the computation. And that's also what the Transformer does. When it has blocks that communicate and then compute, and it groups them and replicates them.  Okay, so let me show you what we like to do. We'd like, to do something like this, we have a block. And this block is basically this part here.  Except for the cross attention.  Now the block basically intersperses communication and then computation the computation. The communication is done is using multi-headed, self-attention and then the computation is done using a feed forward Network on all the tokens in independently.  now, what I've added here also is, you'll notice  this takes the number of embeddings in the embedding Dimension and number of heads that we would like which is kind of like group size in group convolution and I'm saying that number of heads we'd like is for. And so, because this is 32, we calculate that because this 32, the number of has should be four Um, there's no the head should be 8 so that everything sort of works out Channel wise.  So this is how the Transformer structures sort of the sizes typically.  So the head size will become 8, and then this is how we want to intersperse them. And then here, I'm trying to create blocks which is just a sequential application of block block, so that we're interspersing communication feed-forward many many times. And then finally, we decode  Now actually try to run this and the problem is this doesn't actually give a very good answer.  And very good result. And the reason for that is we're starting to actually get like a pretty deep neural net. And the neural Nets are suffer from optimization issues and I think that's what we're kind of like slightly starting to run into. So we need one more idea that we can borrow from the Transformer paper to resolve those difficulties. Now, there are two optimizations that dramatically help with the depth of these networks and make sure that the networks remain optimizable. Let's talk about the first one.  The first one in this diagram, is you see this Arrow here?  And then the Sarah, and this Arrow, those are skip connections, or sometimes called, residual connections.  They come from this paper, the Precision learning forum is recognition from about 2015 that introduced the concept. now, these are basically what it means is you transform the data, but then you have a skip connection with addition  From the previous features.  Now, the way I like to visualize it, that I prefer is the following here. The computation happens from the top to bottom and basically you have this residual pathway  and you are free to Fork off from the residual pathway, perform some computation and then project back to the residual pathway via Edition.  And so you go from the  the inputs to the targets, only the plus, and plus, and plus  And the reason this is useful is because during bad propagation. Remember from our microgrid video earlier Edition, distributes gradients equally to both of its branches that that is the input. And so the supervision or the gradients from the laws, basically hop through every Edition node, all the way to the input and then all into the residual blocks.  But basically have this gradient superhighway that goes directly from the supervision old way to the input unimpeded. And then these virtual blocks are usually initialized in the beginning. So they contribute very very little if anything to the residual pathway, they are initialized that way. So in the beginning they are sort of almost kind of like not there but then during the optimization they come online over time and they start to contribute. But at least at the initialization, you can go from directly supervision to the input. Gradient this unimpeded and just flows and then the blocks over time kick in and so that dramatically helps with the optimization. So, let's implement this. So coming back to our block here. Basically, what we want to do is  We want to do x equals X, Plus.  Solve attention and x equals X Plus salt.the forward.  So this is X and then we Fork off and do some communication and come back and we Fork off and we do some computation and come back.  So those are residual connections and then swinging back up here.  We also have to introduce this projection.  So, and then dot linear.  And this is going to be from.  Actual, we concatenate this. This is the size and embed.  So, this is the output of the South tension itself.  But then we actually want the two, apply the projection. And that's the result.  So the projection is just a linear transformation of the outcome of this layer.  So that's the projection back into the residual pathway.  And then, here in a feed-forward, it's going to be the same thing. I could have a self that projection here as well, but let me just simplify it.  And let me a couple it inside the same sequential container.  And so this is the projection layer going back into the residual pathway.  and so,  that's well, that's it. So now we can train this. So I implemented one more small change. When you look into the paper again, you see that the dimensionality of input and output is 512 for them. And they're saying that the inner layer here in the feet forward has dimensionality of 2048. So there's a multiplier of four.  and so the inner layer of the feet forward Network,  Should be multiplied by four in terms of channels Asus. So I came here and I multiply four times, embed here for the feet forward and then from four times and embed coming back down to an embed. When we go back to the project to the projection. So adding a bit of computation here and growing that layer, that is in the residual, block on the side of the original pathway. And then I trained this and we actually get down all the way to 2. 0 8.  and our  Generations, here are still not amazing, but at least you see that we can see like is here this now Greaves sink.  Like this starts to almost look like English. So yeah, we're starting to really get there. Okay, in the second Innovation. That is very helpful for optimizing. Very deep. Neural networks is right here.  So we have this addition, now that's the residual part, but this Norm is referring to something called layer Norm.  So, layer Norm is implemented in pytorch. It's a paper that came out a while back here.  And later Norm is very, very similar to Bosch Norm. So remember back to our make more series part 3, we implemented bathroom realization.  And Bastion realization basically, just make sure that across the batch Dimension, any individual neurons had unit. Gaussian distribution. So was 0 mean and unit standard deviation one, standard deviation upload. so, what I did here is, I'm copy pasting, the bass, drum 1D, that we developed in our make more series,  And see here we can initialize. For example, this module and we can have a batch of 32 100 dimensional vectors feeding through the batch arm layer  so, what this does is it guarantees  that when we look at just the 0th column,  it's a zero mean one standard deviation, so it's normalizing every single column of this input.  Now, the rows are not going to be normalized by default because we're just normalizing columns.  So, let's not Implement layer Norm, it's very complicated. Look, we come, here we change this from 0 to 1.  So, we don't normalize The Columns we normalize the roads.  And now we've implemented layer Norm.  So now the columns are not going to be normalized.  But the rows are going to be normalized for every individual example, it's 100 dimensional. Vector is normalized in this way and because our computation, Now does not span across examples. We can delete all of this buffers stuff because we can always apply this operation and don't need to maintain any running buffers. So, we don't need the buffers.  We don't, There's no distinction between training and test time.  And we don't need these running buffers. We do keep gamma and beta. We don't need the momentum, we don't care if it's training or not.  And this is now a layer Norm.  And it normalizes the rows is that of the columns and this here.  Is identical to basically this here.  So let's now Implement layer Norm in our Transformer before I incorporate the layer. Know I just wanted to know that as I said, very few details about the Transformer have changed in the last five years. But this is actually something that's like the parts from the original paper. You see that the ADD and Norm is applied after the transformation.  But in now it is a bit more basically common to apply the layer Norm before the transformation. So, there's a reshuffling of the layer Norms. So this is called the pre Norm formulation and that the one that we're going to implement as well. So select deviation from the original paper,  Basically, we need to learn Norms layer. Normal one is and then dot layer norm. And we tell it how many, what does the embedding dimension? And we need the second layer Norm.  And then, here, the layer arms are applied immediately on x.  so, solve that layer Norm 1 in apply to next  And sell that layer number two applied on X, before it goes into self-attention and feed forward.  And the size of the layer Norm, here is an embed. So 32  So, when the layer Norm is normalizing, our features. It is the normalization here.  Happens in the mean and the variance are taking over 32 numbers. So the batch and the time act as backed Dimensions, both of them.  So this is kind of like a token transformation that just normalizes the features and makes them unit mean unit gaussian at initialization.  But of course, because these layer Norms inside, it have these gamma and beta trainable parameters.  The layer normal eventually create outputs that might not be, you know, gaussian but the optimization will determine that.  So for now this is the this is incorporating the learns and let's train them up.  Okay, so I let it run and we see that we get down to 2. 0 6. One more thing I forgot to add is that there should be a layer Norm here. Also, typically as at the end of the Transformer and right before the final linear layer that decodes into vocabulary.  So, I added that as well.  So at this stage, we actually have a pretty complete Transformer according to the original paper and it's a decoder only Transformer. I'll talk about that in a second but at this stage, the major piece are in place. So we can try to scale this up and see how well we can push this number.  Now, in order to scale out the model, I had to perform some cosmetic changes here to make it nice or so. I introduced this variable called n layer, which just specifies, how many layers of the blocks we're going to have  I created a bunch of blocks and we have a new variable number of heads as well.  I pulled out the layer Norm here and so this is identical.  Now, one thing that I did briefly change is I added dropout.  So Dropout is something that you can add right before the residual connection back.  Right before the connection back into the original pathway.  So we can drop out that as the last layer here.  We can drop out here at the end of the multi-headed relationship as well.  And we can also drop out here when we calculate the Basically affinities. And after the softmax, we can drop out some of those. So we can randomly prevent some of the notes from communicating.  And so drop out comes from this paper.  From 2014 or so.  And basically, it takes your neural net.  And it randomly every forward backward, pass shuts. Off some subset of neurons.  So, randomly drops them to 0 and trains without them.  And what this does effectively is because the mask of what being dropped out is changed every single forward. Backward pass it ends up kind of training and Ensemble of sub-networks.  And then at test time, everything is fully enabled and kind of all of those subnetworks are merged into a single Ensemble if you can, if you want to think about it that way. So I would read the paper to get the full detail for now. We're just going to stay on the level of this is a regularization technique and I added it because I'm about to scale up to model quite a bit. And I was concerned about overfitting.  So now when we scroll up to the top, we'll see that. I changed a number of hyper parameters here about our neural. Not so I made the best size. Be much larger now, I was 64  I changed the block size to be 256. So, previously was just eight eight characters of contacts. Now, it is 256 characters of contacts to predict the 257th. I brought down the learning rate a little bit because the neural net is now much bigger. So I brought down the learning rate.  The embedding Dimension is not 384 and there are six heads. So, 384, divides 6 means that every head is 64 dimensional as it as a standard.  And then there are going to be six layers of that.  And the Dropout will be a point two. So every forward backward, passed, 20% of all of these.  Intermediate calculations are disabled and dropped to 0.  And then I already trained this and I ran it. So drum roll, how does it perform?  So let me just scroll up here.  We get a validation loss of 1.48 which is actually quite a bit of an improvement on what we had before, which I think was 2.07. So, we went from 2.07 all the way down to 1. 4 8.  And this, of course, ran for a lot longer. This may be trained for, I want to say about 15 minutes on my 100 GPU, so that's a pretty good GPU.  And if you don't have a GPU, you're not going to be able to reproduce this on the CPU. This would be, I would not run this on the CPU or a Macbook or something like that. You'll have to bring down the number of layers and the embedding Dimension and so on. But in about 15 minutes, we can get this kind of a result and I'm printing.  Some of the Shakespeare here but what I did also is I printed 10,000 characters. So lot more and I wrote them to a file.  And so here we see some of the outputs  so it's a lot more recognizable as the input text file so the input text file, just for reference look like this.  so, there's always like someone speaking in this matter, and  Our predictions. Now, take on that form.  Except of course they're they're not so cool when you actually read them.  So,  It is every crimpy house. Oh, those probation. We give heed.  You know.  Oh, Hast sent me you mighty, Lord.  Anyways, so you can read through this. It's not physical, of course, but this is just a Transformer trained on the Character level for one million characters that come from Shakespeare. So there's sort of like blabber Zone and Shakespeare like manner, but it doesn't of course, make sense at this scale.  But I think, I think still a pretty good demonstration of what's possible. so now,  I think that kind of like concludes the programming section of this video, we basically kind of did a pretty good job and implementing this Transformer, but the picture doesn't exactly match up to what we've done. So, what's going on with all these digital Parts here?  So, let me finish explaining this architecture and why it looks so funky.  Basically, What's Happening Here is? Well, we implemented here is a decoder only Transformer.  So there's no component here. This part is called the encoder and there's no cross attention. Block here, our block only has a self-attention and defeat forward. So it is missing this third in between piece here. This piece does cross attention. So we don't have it and we don't have the encoder, we just have the decoder and the reason we have a decoder only  Is because we are just generating text and its unconditioned on anything or just we're just blabbering on according to a given data set.  What makes it a decoder is that we are using the Triangular mask in our Transformer. So it has this Auto regressive property where we can just go and sample from it.  So, the fact that it's using the triangle triangular mask to mask out the attention, makes it a decoder. And it can be used for language modeling.  Now, the reason that the original paper had an encoder, decoder architecture is because it is a machine translation paper. So it is concerned with a different setting in particular.  it expects some tokens that encode say for example, French  And then it is expected to decode the translation in English.  So you typically, these here are special tokens, so you are expected to read in this and condition on it.  And then you start off the generation of the special token called start. So this is a special new token that you introduced and always place in the beginning.  And then the network is expected to Output neural. Networks are awesome and then a special and token to finish the generation.  So this part here will be decoded, exactly. As we've done it. Neural networks are awesome. We'll be identical to what we did.  But unlike what we did, they won't to condition the generation on some additional information. And in that case, this additional information is the French sentence that they should be translated.  So what they do now?  Is they bring the encoder? Now the encoder reads this part here. So we're all going to take the part of French and we're going to create tokens from it. Exactly. As we've seen in our video and we're going to put a Transformer on it, but there's going to be no triangular mask. And so, all the tokens are allowed to talk to each other as much as they want. And they're just encoding, whatever the content of this French sentence.  Once they've encoded it.  They basically come out in the top here.  And then what happens here is in our decoder, which does the language modeling, there's an additional connection here to the outputs of the encoder.  And that is brought in through a cross attention.  So, the query is still generated from X, but now the keys and the values are coming from the side. The keys and values are coming from the top.  Generated by the nodes that came outside of the encoder.  And those tops, the keys in the valleys there, the top of it.  Feeding on a side into every single block of the decoder. And so that's why there's an additional cross attention and really, what is doing is its conditioning, the decoding not just on the past of this current decoding, but also on having seen the full fully encoded French prompt sort of And so it's an inch or decoder model, which is why we have those two Transformers and additional block and so on. So we did not do this because we have no we have nothing to encode. There's no conditioning. We just have a text file and we just want to imitate it and that's why we are using a decoder, only Transformer, exactly as done in GPT.  Okay, so now I wanted to do a very brief walkthrough a minGPT, which you can find on my GitHub.  And that LGBT is basically two files of Interest. There's trained up pi and Mild up by  Train that pie as older boilerplate code for training the network, it is basically all the stuff that we had here is the training Loop.  It's just that it's a lot more complicated because we are saving and loading checkpoints and pre-trained weights and we are the king the learning rate and compelling them model and using distributed training across multiple nodes or gpus. So the training that Pi gets a little bit more hairy complicated. There's more options. Etc.  But the model that buy should look very, very similar to what we've done here. In fact, the model is almost identical.  So first here, we have the causal cell potential block, and all of this should look very, very recognizable to you. We're producing quarries Keys values. We're doing Dot products. We're masking applying softmax optionally dropping out. And here we are pooling the wood, the values. What is different here? Is that in our code?  I have.  Separated out the multi-headed attention into just a single individual head.  And then here, I have multiple heads and I explicitly concatenate them.  Whereas here all of it is implemented in a batched manner, inside a single causal self-attention. And so we don't just have a b and a T and A C Dimension. We also end up with a fourth dimension, which is the heads,  And so it just gets a lot more sort of hairy because we have four dimensional array 10 Source. Now but it is equivalent mathematically. So the exact same thing is happening as what we have, it's just, it's a bit more efficient because all the heads are not treated as a batch Dimension as well.  then we have multiple layer perceptron, it's using the gallon nonlinearity which is defined here except instead of relu and this is done just because opening I used it and I want to be able to load their checkpoints  The blocks of the Transformer are identical, the communicate and the compute phase as we saw, and then the GPT will be identical. We have the positioning token. Encodings the blocks the layer Norm at the end. The final linear layer.  And this should look all very recognizable. And there's a bit more here because I'm loading checkpoints and stuff like that. I'm separating out the parameters into those that should be weight decade and those that shouldn't  But the generate function should also be very, very similar. So a few details are different but you should definitely be able to look at this file and be able to understand a lot of the pieces. Now,  So, let's now bring things back to chat GPT.  What would it look like if we wanted to train chat apt ourselves? And how does it relate to what we learned today?  Well, to train and ChatGPT, there are roughly two stages. First is the pre-training stage and then the fine-tuning stage.  In the pre-training stage, we are training on the large chunk of internet and just trying to get a first decoder only Transformer to babble to text, so it's very, very similar to what we've done ourselves.  Except we unlock a tiny little baby pre-training step. And so, in our case, this is how you print a number of parameters, I printed it, and it's about 10 million. So this Transformer that I created here to create little Shakespeare, Transformer was about 10 million parameters. Our data set is roughly 1 million characters. So roughly 1 million tokens, but you have to remember that opening is different vocabulary. They're not on the Character level. They use these subworld chunks of words and so they have a vocabulary of 50,000 roughly elements and so their sequences are a bit more condensed. so, our data set, the Shakespeare data set would be probably around 300,000 tokens in the opening our vocabulary roughly  So, we trained about 10 million primary model on roughly 300,000 tokens.  Now, when you go to the GPT3 paper,  And you look at the Transformers that they trained.  They trained a number of Transformers of different sizes, but the biggest Transformer here has 175 billion parameters. So ours is again 10 million.  They use this number of layers in a Transformer. This is the n in bed.  This is the number of heads and this is the head size.  And then this is the batch size. So ours was 65.  And learning to similar. Now when they train this Transformer, they trained on 300 billion tokens  So again remember ours is about 300,000. So this is about a million fold increase and this number would not be even that large by today's standards. You'd be going up one trillion and above  So they are training a significantly larger model. On a good chunk of the internet and that is the pre training stage. But otherwise these hyperparameters should be fairly recognizable to you and the architecture is actually like nearly identical to what we implemented ourselves but of course it's a massive infrastructure challenge to train this you're talking about typically thousands of gpus having to, you know, talk to each other to train models of this size. So that's just a pre-training stage. Now, after you complete the pre-training stage, you don't get something that a response to your questions with answers and it's not helpful and Etc. You get a document completed, right? So, in babbles, but it doesn't Babble Shakespeare in Babel's internet, it will create arbitrary news articles and documents and they will try to complete documents because that's what it's trained for. Its trying to complete the sequence.  So when you give it a question, it would just potentially just give you more questions. It would follow with more questions. It will do whatever it looks like. The some clothes document would do in the training data on the internet. And so who knows, you're getting kind of like undefined Behavior. It might basically answer with two questions with other questions, it might ignore your question. It might just try to complete some news article. It's totally on the line as we say. So the second fine-tuning stage is to actually align it to be an assistant. And this is the second stage.  And so this ChatGPT block post from opening. It talks a little bit about how the stage is achieved.  We basically.  There's roughly three steps to to this stage. So what they do here is they start to collect training data. That looks specifically like what an assistant would do. So they are documents that have the format where the question is on top. And then an answer is below and they have a large number of these, but probably not on the order of the internet. This is probably on the order of maybe thousands of examples.  And so they then fine-tune the model to basically only focus on documents that look like that. And so you're starting to slowly align it. So it's going to expect a question at the top and it's going to expect to complete the answer.  And these very very large models are very simple efficient during their fine tuning. So this actually some works but that's just step one that's just fine tuning. So then they actually have more steps where okay the second step is you let the model respond and then different Raiders. Look at the different responses and rank them for their preference to which one is better than the other they use that to train a reward model so they can predict basically using a different network. How much of any candidate response would be desirable and then once they have a reward model, they run PPO, which is a form of palsy policy, gradient reinforcement learning optimizer,  To fine-tune this sampling policy. So that the answers that the GPT. Now generates our expected to score a high reward, according to the reward model.  And so basically, there's a whole, the lining stage here or fine-tuning stage. It's got multiple steps in between there as well and it takes the model from being a document completed to a question answer and that's like a whole separate stage. A lot of this data is not available publicly. It is internal to opening Ai and it's much harder to replicate this stage.  And so that's roughly. What would give you a church? GPT and Nano GPT focuses on the pre-training stage, okay? And that's everything that I wanted to cover today. So, we trained to summarize a decoder only Transformer following this famous paper attention is all you need from 2017.  And so that's basically a GPT we trained it on Tiny Shakespeare and got sensible results.  All of the training code is roughly. 200 lines of code.  I will be releasing this codebase. So also it comes with all the git log commits along the way as we build it up.  In addition to this code, I'm going to release the notebook, of course, the Google collab.  And I hope that gave you a sense for how you can train.  These models, like, say GPT3 that will be architecturally basically identical to what we have. But there are somewhere between 10,000 and 1 million times bigger depending on how you count.  And so that's all I have for now. We did not talk about any of the fine tuning stages that would typically go on top of this. So if you're interested in something that's not just language modeling but you actually want to you know say perform tasks or you want them to be aligned in a specific way or you want to detect sentiment or anything like that. Basically, anytime you don't want something, that's just a document completed. You have to complete further stages of fine tuning, which we did not cover.  And that could be simple, supervised fine-tuning or it can be something more fancy. Like we see in charge EPT. We are actually trained a reward model and then do runs of PPO to align it with respect to the reward model.  So there's a lot more that can be done on top of it. I think, for now we're starting to get to about two hours Mark. So I'm going to Kind of finish here.  I hope you enjoyed the lecture. And yeah, go forth and transform. See you later.",
