# Dungeon Adventure using CrewAI and Gemini

This Colab showcases a basic agentic framework for a text-based dungeon
adventure game, utilizing CrewAI and Gemini. It offers an interactive experience
with agents taking on roles such as the Dungeon Master and players with distinct
characters and objectives. The setup simulates a fantasy adventure,
demonstrating CrewAI's capabilities in dynamically guiding an evolving story.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this notebook is to demonstrate how to use CrewAI and Gemini
for creating interactive storytelling experiences. The notebook features:

- A Dungeon Master (DM) agent, responsible for narrating scenes, evaluating
  player actions, and introducing challenges.
- Player agents with unique roles and goals, adding depth to the adventure.

## TODOs

Future enhancements to this dungeon adventure framework could include:

- **Image Generation**: Automatically generate images for each turn to enhance
  storytelling.
- **Campaign Termination**: Equip the DM with the ability to either conclude the
  campaign or progress indefinitely, rather than halting after a pre-set number
  of turns.
- **Character Properties**: Introduce attributes such as health, intelligence,
  dexterity, charisma, etc., for more detailed character development.
- **Inventory System**: Implement mechanisms for characters to gather, lose, and
  utilize items throughout their journey.
- **Spell Learning**: Allow characters to learn and cast spells, adding a
  magical dimension to the gameplay.

With these improvements, the framework can become a more immersive and engaging
experience for users exploring the potential of agent-driven storytelling.
