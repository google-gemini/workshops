<!--
Tay was not an LLM; but became a warning for reputational risk
of chatbots.

Transformers paper, paved the way for LLMs; came out in 2017.

Google announces first true LLM, LaMDA, in 2021; what happened in the
mean time? Working on scaling; taking a paper and productionizing a
lot of work: infrastructure, data, efficient training algorithms,
development of new chips, etc.

ChatGPT in 2022; and Gemini in 2023. What a difference a couple months
makes!

# What can LLMs do now?

---

# Medical triage in rural areas

<v-clicks>

- In Turkana County, LLMs can guide rural health workers in diagnosing common
  diseases like malaria via mobile apps, reducing the need for travel to distant
  clinics.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Kenya

---

# Preservation of languages

<v-clicks>

- LLMs trained on Dinka can create educational tools and translations, helping
  preserve the language for future generations.

</v-clicks>

<!--
South Sudan
-->

---

# Multilingual government communication

<v-clicks>

- An LLM can translate voter education materials into Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa,
  making government information accessible to non-English speakers during
  elections.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Nigeria

---

# Disaster response

<v-clicks>

- LLMs can provide flood warnings and evacuation routes in both Portuguese and
  Umbundu, ensuring rural communities stay informed during the rainy season.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Angola

---

# Agricultural support

<v-clicks>

- In Southern Province, LLMs could provide drought-resistant crop advice in
  Tonga, helping farmers sustain maize production during dry seasons.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Zambia

# Where are LLMs going?

<!--
Future of LLMs might fall into one of three scenarios, like the future of the universe (perpetually expanding, contracting, or achieving equilibrium).

# LLM super-intelligence

LLMs achieve super-human intelligence; new physics; inter-planetary travel; etc.

# LLM saturation

</figure>

<!--
LLMs peter out after the saturation of training data.

# LLM collapse

    <strong>Figure 4</strong>: This scenario occurs if LLMs start relying heavily on synthetic data, which could lead to <span v-mark.highlight.yellow="{ at: 3 }">model collapse</span>.

<!--
Due to over-reliance on synthetic data, LLMs collapse.
